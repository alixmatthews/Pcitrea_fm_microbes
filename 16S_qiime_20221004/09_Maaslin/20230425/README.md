Maaslin analyses, results, and figures

#### Data files in this directory and used for this step:
- `MaAsLin2_16S_20230425.R`: maaslin analyses in R for 16S
- `16S_grouped-filtered-decontam-bio_samples-silva-level-2_nomissing_relabun_curated_MaAsLin2.csv`: phyla level input file for analyses
- `16S_grouped-filtered-decontam-bio_samples-silva-level-5_nomissing_relabun_curated_MaAsLin2.csv`: family level input file for analyses
- `16S_grouped-filtered-decontam-bio_samples-silva-level-6_nomissing_relabun_curated_MaAsLin2.csv`: genus level input file for analyses
- `16S_ITS_COMBO_RESULTS_phyla_family_genus.xlsx`: results file, includes 16S and ITS results (all results at the phyla, family, and genus levels)
- `16S_ITS_COMBO_MaAsLin2_figures.R`: making the figures file, includes 16S and ITS figure-making
- `16S_grouped-filtered-decontam-bio_samples-silva-level-6_nomissing_relabun_curated_MaAsLin2_PREVALENCEABUNDANCE.xlsx`: calculations of prevalence and abundance at the genus level (which was x-y transformed from the genus level input files for analysis) then separated by mites/feathers to calculate prev/abund, n, etc. of each genus in each group
- `differentially_abundant_16S_ITS_PREVALENCEABUNDANCE.xlsx`: differentially abundant summary based on maaslin results
