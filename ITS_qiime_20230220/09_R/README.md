# R analyses for diversity indices and dietary selection

This directory includes the plotting of alpha and beta diversity indices, for both 'rarefied' data and 500 seqs+ only data. Includes both ITS and 16S results in a single R script, as well as ITS-only csv files (for a few downstream analyses)

#### Specific files in this directory and attribute descriptions:
- `ITS_forward_master_results_20230413.csv`: master dataframe of ITS results only (500plus and 'rarefied') and is used in `10_Maaslin` directory
